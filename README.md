# Python Fundamentals
This repo consists of solved tasks from SoftUni's course Python Fundamentals, January 2025.
Unfortunately, in the beginning I was not really organized enough with the files for the tasks and there are a lot of missing ones. So, if you would like to see a solution that is not there, you can always contact me on my socials. 

 ### Here, in [<b>SoftUni's Judge system</b>](https://judge.softuni.org/Contests/#!/List/ByCategory/191/Python-Fundamentals), you can check your solutions.
